{"name":"Go-aws-ami-poller","tagline":"aws ami poller plugin for go cd","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DennisDenuto/go-aws-ami-poller.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/DennisDenuto/go-aws-ami-poller)\r\n\r\nAWS AMI Poller Plugin for Go\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\nThis is a [package material](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/docs/go/13.3/help/package_material.html) plugin for [Go](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery). It is currently capable of polling [AWS AMI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html/) for a specific region.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour and capabilities of the plugin is determined to a significant extent by that of the package material extension point in Go. Be sure to read the package material documentation before using this plugin.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nJust drop aws-ami-poller.jar into plugins/external directory and restart Go. More details [here](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/docs/go/13.3/help/plugin_user_guide.html)\r\n\r\nRepository definition\r\n---------------------\r\nThe AWS region must be a [valid region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ec2_region).\r\n\r\n\r\nPackage definition\r\n------------------\r\n- AMI name (required) spec refers to the name assigned to the ami at creation time. (Using wildcards are allowed)\r\n- Architecture (optional) accepts the following values (i386 | x86_64)\r\n- Tag-Key (optional)  refers to the key of a tag assigned to the ami. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example,  if  you  use both  the  filter  \"tag-key=Purpose\" and the filter \"tag-value=X\", you get any resources assigned both the tag key  Purpose  (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you  want  to  list  only  resources\r\nwhere Purpose is X, see the tag :key =*value* filter.\r\n- Tag-Value (optional) refers to the value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.\r\n\r\nPublished Environment Variables\r\n-------------------------------\r\nThe following information is made available as environment variables for tasks:\r\n\r\n    GO_PACKAGE_<REPO-NAME>_<PACKAGE-NAME>_LABEL (AMI id)\r\n    GO_REPO_<REPO-NAME>_<PACKAGE-NAME>_REGION (Region AMI belongs to)\r\n\r\nLogging\r\n-------------------------------\r\nThe default logging level for the plugin is set to INFO.\r\nYou can override default value by setting system property 'plugin.pluginId_placeholder.log.level' to required logging level. For example, to set the logging level to WARN for plugin with id 'ami-poller', system property 'plugin.ami-poller.log.level' should be set to WARN.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\nThis plugin will detect at max one package revision per minute (the default interval at which Go materials poll). If multiple versions of a package get published to a repo in the time interval between two polls, Go will register the next sequential (by creationdate) version in that interval.\r\n","google":"UA-68893006-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
